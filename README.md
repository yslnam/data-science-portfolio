## Contents
- ### Data Extraction
	- __Web Scraping__
		- [Scraping TED Talks](): Scraped and parsed unstructured data from TED Talks using Selenium (Python) to identify trends in global issues, science, and technology. (See next: "[Cleaned Scraped TED Talks]()")
		
	_Libraries/Packages: Selenium_ 
	
- ### Data Cleaning, Wrangling, and Processing
	- __Python__
		- [Feature Engineering CitiBike Data](): Cleaned, wrangled, and processed CitiBike data by merging or adding new features for data analysis. (See next: "[Exploring Feature Engineered CitiBike Data]()")
		
	_Libraries/Packages: NumPy, Pandas, Pandas API, datetime, PyProj_ 

	- __R__ 
		- [Cleaning Scraped TED Talks](): Cleaned and wrangled scraped data from TED Talks. (See previously: "[Scraping TED Talks]()"; See next: "[Measuring Trendiness of TED Talks]()")
		
	_Libraries/Packages: tidyverse, lubridate, janitor_ 		

- ### Data Analysis
	- __Python__
		- [Exploring Feature Engineered CitiBike Data](): Conducted exploratory data analysis of feature engineered CitiBike Data. Identified user, geographic, and station usage, and net inflow/outflow patterns in CitiBike rides in order to identify underserved population. (See previously: "[Feature Engineering CitiBike Data]()"; See next: "[Visualizing Patterns in CitiBike Rides]()")
		
	_Libraries/Packages: NumPy, Pandas, Pandas API, datetime, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly_ 

	- __R__ 
		- [Exploring Conflict Risk Indicators](): Created a "quick and dirty" exploratory data analysis dashboard and interactive tool. Developed a Shiny app to compile all interactive visualizations. (See next: "[Globally Mapping Conflict Risk Indicators]()")
	
		- [Measuring "Trendiness" of TED Talks](): Constructed multivariate and composite indicators to measure “trendiness” of global issues, science, and technology TED Talks. (See previously: "[Cleaning Scraped TED Talks]()"; See next: "[Visualizing Trends in TED Talks]()")
	
	_Libraries/Packages: tidyverse, tidyr, lubridate, Shiny, shinydashboard, shinythemes, rgdal, leaflet, sp, RColorBrewer, reshape2_  

- ### Modeling
	- __Machine Learning__
		- [Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa](): Modeled and predicted housing prices in Ames, Iowa using random forest, an unsupervised learning method. (See next: "[Valuating Houses in Ames, Iowa]()")
		
	 _Libraries/Packages:_ 
	
	- __NLP__
		- [User Sentiment on TED Talk Trends](): Modeled and analyzed user comments from trending TED Talks in global issues, science, and technololgy. (See previously: "[Measuring 'Trendiness' of TED Talks](); See next: "[Visualizing Trends in TED Talks]()")
		
	 _Libraries/Packages: NTLK, scikit-learn_ 

- ### Data Visualization
	- __Python__
		- [Valuating Houses in Ames, Iowa](): Selected key features in predictive random forest modeling for housing prices in Ames, Iowa. Used "black box" deconstruction techniques to interpret random forest model and results. (See previously: "[Predicting Housing Prices in Ames, Iowa]()")
	
		- [Visualizing Patterns in CitiBike Rides](): Visualized user, geographic, and station usage patterns in CitiBike rides from feature engineered data. 
		
	_Libraries/Packages: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, pprint, rfpimp, treeinterpreter_ 

	- __R__ 
		- [Globally Mapping Conflict Risk Indicators](): Created an interactive map of conflict risk indicators by country using leaflet. Developed a Shiny app to compile all interactive visualizations. (See previously: "[Exploring Conflict Risk Indicators]()")
		
		- [Visualizing Trends in TED Talks](): Visualized trends in global issues, science, and technology TED Talks using self-constructed multivariate and composite indicators. (See previously: "[User Sentiment on TED Talk Trends]()")
		
  	_Libraries/Packages: tidyverse, scales, paletteer, ggally, hrbrthemes, Shiny, shinydashboard, shinythemes, rgdal, leaflet, sp, RColorBrewer, reshape2_
